                <p>
                    I’ve always dreamed of traveling abroad to explore new cultures, taste different cuisines, and
                    experience the wonders of the world. Sadly, I haven’t had the opportunity yet. However, I have
                    realized that Indonesia itself offers unforgettable destinations that are equally magical. From
                    mountains covered in mist to beaches glowing with golden sunsets, each trip has given me stories
                    worth keeping. In this section, I’ll share some of the most memorable places I’ve visited in
                    Indonesia, as well as my dream destination abroad. These journeys made me appreciate my homeland
                    while still fueling my dream to step into foreign lands one day.

                <h2>Dieng Plateau</h2>
                <p>
                    Visiting Dieng feels like stepping into another world. The air is so cold that even during the day,
                    you can see your breath as if it were winter. Farmers there grow a special type of chili that looks
                    like jalapeños but with its own fiery kick. Beyond that, the colorful Telaga Warna lake and the
                    ancient Hindu temples scattered across the plateau add an almost mystical charm to the region. For
                    me, Dieng is both chilling and enchanting—literally.

                <h2>Bali</h2>
                <p>
                    Bali is not only about stunning beaches, but also about its delicious cuisine. One of the most
                    unforgettable meals I had there was the famous <em>babi guling</em>—a roasted pig dish bursting with
                    flavor and spices. But what makes Bali truly unique is how culture and daily life blend together:
                    traditional dance performances in small villages, temple offerings lining the streets, and the
                    warm smiles of locals welcoming every visitor. Every corner of Bali feels alive with tradition and
                    energy.

                        style="background-color:#fa0f0fb9; color:#fff; padding:5px; border-radius:10px;">Japan</span></h2>
                <p>
                    If there’s one country abroad I want to visit the most, it’s Japan. The iconic Shibuya Crossing in
                    Tokyo has always fascinated me, especially seeing it in countless movies and videos online. Beyond
                    that, Japanese cuisine—sushi, ramen, and so much more—feels like a dream for my taste buds. I also
                    admire how clean and organized the cities are, making every corner look perfect. Japan, to me, is
                    the ultimate blend of tradition, modernity, and perfection. Someday, I hope to walk its streets in
                    person.
